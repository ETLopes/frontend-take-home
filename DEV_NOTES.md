# DEV NOTES

## UI

 - During the development I've found some inconsistencies between the screens on the design. I plan to discuss my decisions at the meeting.
 - There are still a few components that are missing some alignment. Due to the timeframe I had to make some compromises.
 - I have a solution in my head for the colors, so they wouldn't need to be passed inline. 
 - Also, for the 3 dots menu, since it had no explicit functionality I decided not to implement it. I've based my decision on a cursor hover on the design pointing that that action would be the correct action.

## Feature

 - Due to the inconsistencies in the design, I had to make some decisions on how to implement the feature. I plan to discuss these decisions at the meeting.
 - The Right Panel on the web version is inconsistent, because you cannot add a new Item without selecting a previous one. 

## Testing

### Unit Tests

 - I have added some unit tests on the lib folder. 
 - In the future we would add the react-testing-library to test the components.
